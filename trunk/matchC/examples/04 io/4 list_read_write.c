/*
 * Function list_read_write reads n elements from the standard input and writes

 * elements into a singly-linked list, which is allocated as the elements are
 * read. Then it outputs the n elements from the list, which is deallocated as
 * the element are written. In the end, the heap stays unchanged (implicitly
 * stated, because the heap does not appear in the function specification).
